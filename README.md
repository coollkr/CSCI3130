# Frontend


# Prerequisites



* npm: 8.5.5 
* node: 16.15
* Download an IDE that runs javascript and node.js (VS Code is a good choice)


# Installation



* npm install (cd to FrontEnd/group-project first) - this installs the node_modules which are not pushed to git


# Running the Frontend



* npm run start (cd to FrontEnd/group-project first)
* Ensure youâ€™re running the front end on localhost: 3000 as that is the port that the back end is listening to


# Backend


# Prerequisites



* Download an IDE of your choice.. 
    * Note: VS Code allows you to run both frontend and back end at the same time, instead of running frontend on VS code and backend on another IDE,
* Connection to remote database
* JDK 17
* Maven 4.0.0  


# Installation



* When opening backend in IDE, ensure you have the correct JDK and maven versions


# Running the Backend



* Connect to remote database using
    * username: csci3130_group15
    * password: EeSo5eiyoh
* IF USING INTELLIJ: Remove the .iml file before opening the project in IntelliJ, if a Load Maven pop-up comes up, click load
* Locate and run the TrelloProjectApplication.java file
