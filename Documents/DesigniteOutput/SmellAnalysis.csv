Implementation Smells,,,,,
Method Name,Implementation Smell,Cause of the Smell,Method start line no,Justification,
UserModel,Long Parameter List,The method has 5 parameters.,30,It is a constructor.. it requires all of that information to populate an object,
getTaskWithDate,Complex Conditional,The conditional expression getBoardTaskStatus && excludeDoneColumn && compareOverdueDates is complex.,81,Boolean added to remove long expression from conditional,
getTaskWithDate,Complex Method,Cyclomatic complexity of the method is 9,81,"Ideally this method should be broken up into smaller methods to reduce complexity, however there is not enough time before the release is due, so it will not be refactored.",
getTaskWithDate,Long Statement,"The length of the statement ""boolean compareDayMonthYear=((boardTasksDate.getYear() == year) && (boardTasksDate.getMonthValue() == month) && (boardTasksDate.getDayOfMonth() == day));"" is 153.",81,Booleans were added to break the statement down,
getTaskWithDate,Long Statement,"The length of the statement ""boolean compareOverdueDates=((boardTasksDate.getYear() <= year) && (boardTasksDate.getMonthValue() <= month) && (boardTasksDate.getDayOfMonth() < day));"" is 152.",81,Booleans were added to break the statement down,

main,Group_15.Trello_Project,IncorrectPasswordException,Unnecessary Abstraction,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields are declared in this class:,"It's an exception, doesn't need to be refactored"
main,Group_15.Trello_Project,EmailNotRegisteredException,Unnecessary Abstraction,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields are declared in this class:,"It's an exception, doesn't need to be refactored"
main,Group_15.Trello_Project,TrelloProjectApplication,Unutilized Abstraction,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.

Following fields are declared in this class:,"It's an exception, doesn't need to be refactored"
main,Group_15.Trello_Project.board.controller,BoardController,Unutilized Abstraction,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused. (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.),"It's a necessary abstraction, doesn't need to be refactored"
main,Group_15.Trello_Project.board.service,BoardService,Cyclically-dependent Modularization,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: TaskService; BoardService,"These classes all depend on eachother for functionality, doesn't need to be refactored"

main,Group_15.Trello_Project.task.service,TaskService,Feature Envy,The tool detected a instance of this smell because assignUserToTask is more interested in members of the type: UserServiceImplementation,"If there was more time before the release, we would move the relationship of tasks and users from user, into task, to remove the Feature envy.. however, sadly limited time we have will not allow such large changes to the code base"

Architecture Smells,,,,,
Project Name,Package Name,Architecture Smell,Cause of the Smell,Justification,
main,Group_15.Trello_Project,Ambiguous Interface,The tool detected the smell in this component because the component provides only a single general entry-point via the following class: TrelloProjectApplication,This class is needed to run the application,
main,Group_15.Trello_Project,Feature Concentration,The tool detected the smell in this component because the component realizes more than one architectural concern/feature. Independent sets of related classes within this component are: [IncorrectPasswordException]; [EmailNotRegisteredException]; [TrelloProjectApplication]; [NewPasswordSameAsOldPasswordException]; [IncorrectSecurityAnswerException]; [EmailAlreadyRegisteredException]. LCC (Lack of Component Cohesion) = 1.0,"No, it's not really a smell, these are exceptions needed for error handling",
main,Group_15.Trello_Project.board.service,Cyclic Dependency,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating components in the cycle are: Group_15.Trello_Project.board.service; Group_15.Trello_Project.task.service,"Boards and Tasks depend on eachother, doesn't need to be refactored",
main,Group_15.Trello_Project.board.service,Unstable Dependency,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component depends on other components that are less stable than itself. This component depends on following less stable component(s): Group_15.Trello_Project.task.service,"boards and Tasks depend on eachother, doesn't need to be refactored",
main,Group_15.Trello_Project.user.service,Scattered Functionality,The tool detected the smell in this component because a set of two or more components realizes the same high-level architectural concern. Following components realize the same concern: Group_15.Trello_Project.user.repository; Group_15.Trello_Project.user.entity.,"Boards are both a member of workspaces, and are host to tasks, there will be board functionality scattered in both of those classes ",
main,Group_15.Trello_Project.task.service,Cyclic Dependency,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating components in the cycle are: Group_15.Trello_Project.task.service; Group_15.Trello_Project.board.service,"Boards and tasks depend on eachother, doesn't need to be refactored",

Following components realize the same concern: Group_15.Trello_Project.board.service; Group_15.Trello_Project.board.entity; Group_15.Trello_Project.task.entity.,"Tasks interact with both boards and users, there will be scattered functionality, doesn't need to be refactored",
